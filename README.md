Relay is a structured workflow system for building software with AI. You direct the strategy — what to build, what to prioritize, when to ship. AI handles the scale — analyzing codebases, generating plans, reviewing implementations, verifying correctness. A persistent `.relay/` layer grows with every session, capturing decisions, context, and progress so nothing is ever lost between humans, models, or tools. Works with **Claude Code**, **OpenAI Codex CLI**, and **Google Gemini CLI**.

## The Problem

When you use AI to build software, you're fighting three forces:

- **AI amnesia** — every conversation starts from zero. The model doesn't know what it built yesterday, which approach failed, or what's queued up next.
- **Context fragmentation** — work spreads across sessions, tools, and people. Decisions live in chat logs that expire. Plans exist in one model's context window and vanish when the session ends.
- **No structure for what's next** — you know there are bugs to fix and features to build, but there's no system to track them, prioritize them, or work through them in order. Issues pile up in your head or scattered notes. AI can scan your codebase and surface problems automatically, but without a workflow those findings evaporate with the session.

The bigger the project, the worse it gets. You repeat yourself, re-explain architecture, risk undoing past work, and lose the thread of multi-session efforts. Human creativity gets buried under the overhead of re-establishing context.

## The Solution

Relay creates a **living project layer** — a structured `.relay/` directory that serves as shared memory between you and your AI tools:

- **20 workflow skills** cover the full lifecycle: discover, brainstorm, design, exercise, analyze, plan, review, implement, verify, resolve
- **Every skill reads and writes** to the same documentation, building a compounding knowledge base that grows smarter with every session
- **Cross-platform by design** — start analysis in Claude, plan in Gemini, review in Codex. The `.relay/` files are the shared contract; any AI (or human) picks up where the last left off
- **Human-directed, AI-scaled** — you make the creative decisions; AI handles the depth of analysis, breadth of review, and rigor of verification
- **Full audit trail** — plans, reviews, verifications, and archived resolutions preserve the decision history so you can always trace why something was built the way it was
- **Automated issue discovery** — AI scans your codebase for bugs, gaps, inconsistencies, and tech debt, then logs each finding as a structured issue file that persists across sessions
- **Manual issue and feature filing** — spot a bug yourself or have a feature idea? File it directly into the workflow so it's tracked alongside discovered issues
- **Prioritized ordering** — all tracked work is ranked by dependency, severity, and complexity into a phased plan, so you always know what to tackle next
- **Analyze-time scope formation** — when `/relay-analyze` finds sibling bugs or contract drift adjacent to a filed issue, you can group them into a single run, file companion issues, or promote a narrow bug into a broader feature with bidirectional supersession. Closure tiers gate verification rigor by promotion class.

### Memory That Grows

The `.relay/` directory is your project's long-term memory. Every analysis, plan, review, and resolution is persisted as structured markdown — not locked inside any model's context window. This memory compounds over time: each session inherits the full history of what was tried, what worked, and what was rejected. Months of context in seconds.

### Use the Right Model for the Job

Different frontier models have different strengths. Claude reasons deeply about architecture. Gemini processes massive codebases. Codex excels at rapid implementation. With Relay, you're not locked into one — use whichever model is best suited for the task at hand, or simply pick up with whatever's available. Hit your token limit on one? Continue in another without losing a single decision, analysis, or line of the plan. The relay never drops.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Install with npx (recommended)
cd your-project
npx relay-workflow@latest install
```

Or install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/momobits/Relay.git /tmp/relay
cp -r /tmp/relay/.claude/skills/relay-* your-project/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/relay/.claude/skills/relay-* your-project/.agents/skills/
rm -rf /tmp/relay
```

### 2. Setup

In your AI coding CLI (Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini), run:

```
/relay-setup
```

This creates the `.relay/` data directory, generates initial status files, and scans your project for customizations (edge cases, test commands, notebook patterns). Works the same in all three CLIs.

### 3. First Run

```
/relay-discover     — scan the codebase for issues
/relay-scan         — generate relay-status.md
/relay-order        — prioritize the work
/relay-analyze      — start working on the highest-priority item
```

Or explore a new feature idea:
```
/relay-brainstorm   — interactive feature exploration
```

Need help? Run `/relay-help` to see where you are and what to do next.

---

## How It Works

Relay uses **skills** — each workflow step is a skill you invoke with `/relay-*`. The skills read and write to the `.relay/` data directory, building up persistent documentation across sessions. Skills are installed to both `.claude/skills/` (Claude Code) and `.agents/skills/` (Codex CLI, Gemini CLI).

### Workflow Categories

```
PREPARE       DISCOVERY        FEATURE          EXERCISE         CODE
(status)      (find work)      (design work)    (stress-test)    (do work)

/relay-scan   /relay-discover  /relay-brainstorm /relay-exercise  /relay-analyze
  |             (scan for        |                 (map)              |
/relay-order    issues)        /relay-design     /relay-exercise-run  /relay-plan
                                                   (execute)       or /relay-superplan
               /relay-new-issue   |                    |                |
                 (file item)   /relay-cleanup  /relay-exercise-file  /relay-review
                                 (archive stale   (file findings)        |
                                  brainstorms)         |             *implement*
                                                  (feeds into            |
                                                   issues/features)  /relay-verify
                                                                         |
                                                                     /relay-notebook
                                                                         |
                                                                     /relay-resolve
```

The flow between categories: discovery/feature skills create docs → prepare skills prioritize them → code skills implement them. Each skill tells you what to run next.

**Goal mode** — `/relay-exercise "<your goal>"` — inverts the EXERCISE column's orientation: provide a target goal, and the skill builds a top-down journey of required capabilities with adaptive gap handling. See *Walkthrough: Exercising a Capability* below for details.

### Workflow Paths

There are five entry points depending on what you're doing:

```
Specific issue        →  /relay-new-issue  →  /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Systematic scan       →  /relay-discover   →  /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Feature idea          →  /relay-brainstorm → /relay-design → /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Exercise session      →  /relay-exercise → /relay-exercise-run → /relay-exercise-file → /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Exercise auto-sweep   →  /relay-exercise → /relay-exercise-auto → /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Goal-driven exercise  →  /relay-exercise "<your goal>" → /relay-exercise-run → /relay-exercise-file → /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
```

All paths converge on the same **code pipeline** for implementation, ensuring every change gets the same rigor regardless of how it was discovered.

## Walkthrough: Fixing a Bug

### Step 1: Discover the issue

Run `/relay-discover` or `/relay-new-issue`. The AI scans the codebase and creates `.relay/issues/user_auth_token_expired_silently.md`.

### Step 2: Update status and ordering

Run `/relay-scan` then `/relay-order`. The issue appears in relay-ordering.md based on severity.

### Step 3: Analyze (`/relay-analyze`)

The AI reads ALL issues, features, archives, and implemented docs. Produces a structured analysis **appended to the issue file**: validation, root cause, blast radius, approach.

### Step 4: Plan (`/relay-plan` or `/relay-superplan`)

Creates an atomic plan with WHAT/HOW/WHY/RISK/VERIFY/ROLLBACK for each step. **Appended to the issue file**. Use `/relay-superplan` for complex changes — it dispatches 5 agents with different strategies and synthesizes the best approach.

### Step 5: Review (`/relay-review`)

Adversarial review tries to break the plan. Verdict: APPROVED, APPROVED WITH CHANGES, or REJECTED.

### Step 6: Implement

Write the code changes per the finalized plan.

### Step 7: Verify (`/relay-verify`)

Checks each step against the plan, runs regression tests.

### Step 8: Notebook (`/relay-notebook`)

Creates and runs a Jupyter notebook that exercises the real project API end-to-end.

### Step 9: Resolve (`/relay-resolve`)

Archives the issue, creates implementation doc, updates ordering. Then run `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` to refresh status.

**The full lifecycle is documented in one place** — the archived issue file contains the original problem, plan, review, and verification report.

---

## Walkthrough: Building a Feature

### Step 1: Brainstorm (`/relay-brainstorm`)

Interactive exploration of the feature idea. Creates a brainstorm file with approaches, trade-offs, decisions, and feature breakdown.

### Step 2: Design (`/relay-design`)

Designs each feature in detail. Creates individual feature files with architecture, interfaces, data flow.

### Step 3: Prepare

Run `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` to integrate features into the backlog.

### Step 4-9: Code pipeline

For each feature, in order:
```
/relay-analyze → /relay-plan (or /relay-superplan) → /relay-review → implement → /relay-verify → /relay-notebook → /relay-resolve
```

---

## Walkthrough: Exercising a Capability

Each exercise is a **session** — a self-contained attempt to map or stress-test the project against some frame of reference. Sessions live under `.relay/exercise/<session>/`, each with its own `_control.md` holding the session's identity, capabilities, and (in goal mode) the journey. The master hub `.relay/relay-exercise.md` is a project-wide registry across all sessions (Sessions table + Aggregate Capabilities + Aggregate Coverage).

Two modes share the same pipeline — pick one based on what you already know going in:

### Default mode — bottom-up capability map

```
/relay-exercise
```

Scans the project (docs + source), identifies what it can do, confirms identity with the user, and records capabilities + context chains in the session's `_control.md`. Use when you want a structural map of the project regardless of any specific goal.

### Goal mode — top-down journey

```
/relay-exercise "outline a chapter with user-provided constraints"
```

Inverts the orientation: you hand it a target goal, and the skill constructs an ordered **Journey** — each step mapped to an existing project capability (`exists`) or recorded as a `gap` to handle at run time. Journey + `*Mode: goal*` header are stored in `_control.md`. Use when you want to stress-test whether a specific goal is achievable end-to-end.

---

### Step 1: Map (`/relay-exercise` or `/relay-exercise "<goal>"`)

Either invocation creates the session subfolder at `.relay/exercise/<session>/`, writes `_control.md`, and adds a row to the master hub. Default mode produces a capabilities + context-chains view; goal mode produces a journey view. The session is the handle for every subsequent step.

### Step 2: Run (`/relay-exercise-run`)

Execute realistic scenarios against the real application. Findings are captured as structured would-be-issues, would-be-brainstorms, or notes.

- **Default mode:** picks the next uncovered capability (no args) and runs scenarios with prerequisite state established from context chains.
- **Goal mode:** walks the journey end-to-end. On `exists` steps it exercises the mapped capability; on `gap` steps it prompts **alternative** (try a different capability), **file** (seed a brainstorm for the missing feature), or **skip** (continue without it). Exercise files carry a step prefix (`step-1-xxx.md`, `step-2-xxx.md`) so journey order stays visible in the filesystem.

### Step 3: File (`/relay-exercise-file`)

Walk the findings with the user. Each decision is persisted immediately. Would-be-issues become files in `.relay/issues/`. Would-be-brainstorms become seeded brainstorms in `.relay/features/` with partial content for `/relay-brainstorm` to develop later. Notes stay in the exercise file as preserved context. Both modes flow through the same filing step.

**Auto-sweep alternative:** if you'd rather walk the entire session end-to-end without prompting per item, run `/relay-exercise-auto` after Step 1 instead of Steps 2–3. It spawns one isolated agent per capability (default mode) or step (goal mode) that runs the run+file pair with auto-decisions, returning a summary back to the orchestrator. Goal mode asks once for a gap policy (`auto-adapt` / `auto-file` / `auto-skip`) at the start. The main session never absorbs scenario stdout, finding bodies, or filer dialogs — only one progress line per item — keeping the working context clean across long sweeps.

### Step 4: Integrate

Run `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` to integrate the new issues and brainstorms into the backlog. From here, filed issues follow the standard code pipeline (see *"Fixing a Bug"*). Seeded brainstorms can be developed further with `/relay-brainstorm` when you're ready.

### Step 5: Auto-archival

When every issue and brainstorm that came from a session has been resolved through `/relay-resolve`, the session's exercise files are automatically archived to `.relay/archive/exercise/<session>/`. Session identity — and journey, if goal mode — is preserved permanently.

## Lifecycle of an Item

Every issue or feature follows the same documentation lifecycle. Each phase appends to the item file, building a complete record:

### Scope-Formation Lifecycle States (Phase 12)

The simple lifecycle above describes single-item runs. Phase 12 introduced three additional lifecycle states that appear when `/relay-analyze` discovers related work:

- **Grouped run** — multiple sibling items handled as one work unit. `/relay-analyze` records `### Scope Decision` with `*Mode:* grouped run` and a `#### Grouped Entries` table; the plan emits `### Grouped Run Coverage`; verify enforces sibling-survival; resolve archives all siblings together. `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` render the run as a single multi-line block.
- **Promoted feature** — when the real work is broader than a bug fix, the original issue is archived as superseded and a new `.relay/features/<feature>.md` is created with `*Promoted from:*`, `*Promotion Class:* lightweight | broad`, and `*Closure Tier Baseline:* tier-1 | tier-2`. The promoted feature inherits the source's phase slot in `/relay-order`.
- **Superseded issue** — original narrow issue, archived with `> **ARCHIVED - SUPERSEDED**` banner pointing forward to the promoted feature. Receives a `> Closure status: closed YYYY-MM-DD via <feature>.md` back-update when the feature resolves.

**Closure tiers** scale verification rigor with promotion class. Tier 1 covers lightweight promotions; Tier 2 adds subsystem-wide checks for broad promotions. A heuristic waives Tier 2 → Tier 1 when the work is documentation-only (≤ 3 files, prose-only findings, no subsystem invariant), recorded as `*Closure Tier Applied:*` in the feature's front-matter.

For details, see `.relay/relay-readme.md` (the per-project documentation that ships with `/relay-setup`).

## Key Design Decisions

**Everything is persisted in `.md` files.** Plans, reviews, and verifications are appended to the item file — not left in conversation history. Any AI model or human can pick up where the last session left off.

**The code pipeline is the same for issues and features.** Whether you're fixing a one-line bug or building a multi-part feature, the same analyze → plan → review → implement → verify → notebook → resolve sequence applies.

**Archives are memory, not trash.** Resolved items go to `.relay/archive/`, not deleted. Every code skill reads the archives to avoid re-introducing old bugs.

**Reviews are adversarial by design.** `/relay-review` is framed as "try to break the plan" rather than "confirm it's good."

**Notebooks provide executable proof.** Verification notebooks aren't just documentation — they're run against the actual codebase.

**Every skill tells you what to do next.** Each skill ends with a Navigation section that explicitly tells you which skill to run next.

## Adding Skills

To extend the workflow with a new skill:

1. Create a new directory in `.claude/skills/relay-[name]/` (and `.agents/skills/relay-[name]/`) with:
   - `SKILL.md` — frontmatter (name, description) + "Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md."
   - `workflow.md` — the full skill instructions

2. Wire it into the workflow:
   - Add a Navigation entry in the preceding skill that routes to the new one
   - Add it to the skill reference table in this file

3. If the skill requires project-specific customization:
   - Add a Phase 2 step in `/relay-setup` that detects project-specific values and populates `relay-config.md`

## Maintenance

**When to update skills:**
- After adding new integrations, services, or test frameworks — run `/relay-resolve` to refresh customizations, or re-run `/relay-setup` Phase 2
- After changing project structure (module renames, directory moves) — update scoping paths and test commands in `.relay/relay-config.md`
- After finding a workflow gap — fix the skill's `workflow.md`

**Feature file status lifecycle:**
- Brainstorm files: `BRAINSTORMING → READY FOR DESIGN → DESIGN COMPLETE → COMPLETE`
- Individual feature files: `DESIGNED` (created by `/relay-design`) → `IMPLEMENTED` (set by `/relay-resolve` before archiving)
