A skill-driven workflow system that gives AI coding agents persistent memory of what was built, what broke, and what's next. It replaces the ephemeral, conversation-scoped context that AI models operate in with a structured documentation system that survives across sessions, models, and teams.

## The Problem

When you use an AI model to build and maintain a codebase, every conversation starts from zero. The model doesn't know:

- What issue it fixed last week and how
- What feature it designed two hours ago
- Which approach was tried and rejected for a similar problem
- What other parts of the codebase were affected by recent changes
- What work is queued up and in what order it should be tackled

This means you repeat context, re-explain decisions, risk re-introducing fixed bugs, and lose the thread of multi-session work. The bigger the project gets, the worse this becomes.

## The Solution

Relay creates a **living documentation layer** that serves as the AI's project memory:

- **Issues and features** are documented in structured `.md` files with full context
- **Implementation plans, reviews, and verifications** are appended to those files as work progresses
- **Verification notebooks** (`.ipynb`) provide executable proof that changes work
- **Resolved items** are archived with implementation docs, preserving the full decision trail
- **Status and ordering** files are regenerated to reflect current project state
- **Project-specific customizations** are auto-detected during setup and maintained as the codebase evolves

Every AI session reads this documentation before acting. Every session writes back what it did. The result is a continuous, auditable record that any AI model (or human) can pick up and continue.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install

```bash
# Install with npx (recommended)
cd your-project
npx relay-workflow install
```

Or install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/momobits/Relay.git /tmp/relay
cp -r /tmp/relay/.claude/skills/relay-* your-project/.claude/skills/
rm -rf /tmp/relay
```

### 2. Setup

In Claude Code, run:

```
/relay-setup
```

This creates the `.relay/` data directory, generates initial status files, and scans your project for customizations (edge cases, test commands, notebook patterns).

### 3. First Run

```
/relay-discover     — scan the codebase for issues
/relay-scan         — generate relay-status.md
/relay-order        — prioritize the work
/relay-analyze      — start working on the highest-priority item
```

Or explore a new feature idea:
```
/relay-brainstorm   — interactive feature exploration
```

Need help? Run `/relay-help` to see where you are and what to do next.

## How It Works

Relay uses **Claude Code skills** — each workflow step is a skill you invoke with `/relay-*`. The skills read and write to the `.relay/` data directory, building up persistent documentation across sessions.

### Workflow Categories

```
PREPARE          DISCOVERY          FEATURE              CODE
(status)         (find work)        (design work)        (do work)

/relay-scan      /relay-discover    /relay-brainstorm    /relay-analyze
  |                (scan for          |                      |
/relay-order       issues)        /relay-design          /relay-plan
                 /relay-new-issue     |                      |
                   (file item)   /relay-cleanup          /relay-review
                                   (archive stale            |
                                    brainstorms)         *implement*
                                                             |
                                                         /relay-verify
                                                             |
                                                         /relay-notebook
                                                             |
                                                         /relay-resolve
```

The flow between categories: discovery/feature skills create docs → prepare skills prioritize them → code skills implement them. Each skill tells you what to run next.

### Workflow Paths

There are three entry points depending on what you're doing:

```
Specific issue  →  /relay-new-issue  →  /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Systematic scan →  /relay-discover   →  /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
Feature idea    →  /relay-brainstorm → /relay-design → /relay-scan → /relay-order → /relay-analyze → ... → /relay-resolve
```

All paths converge on the same **code pipeline** for implementation, ensuring every change gets the same rigor regardless of how it was discovered.

## Walkthrough: Fixing a Bug

### Step 1: Discover the issue

Run `/relay-discover` or `/relay-new-issue`. The AI scans the codebase and creates `.relay/issues/user_auth_token_expired_silently.md`.

### Step 2: Update status and ordering

Run `/relay-scan` then `/relay-order`. The issue appears in relay-ordering.md based on severity.

### Step 3: Analyze (`/relay-analyze`)

The AI reads ALL issues, features, archives, and implemented docs. Produces a structured analysis **appended to the issue file**: validation, root cause, blast radius, approach.

### Step 4: Plan (`/relay-plan`)

Creates an atomic plan with WHAT/HOW/WHY/RISK/VERIFY/ROLLBACK for each step. **Appended to the issue file**.

### Step 5: Review (`/relay-review`)

Adversarial review tries to break the plan. Verdict: APPROVED, APPROVED WITH CHANGES, or REJECTED.

### Step 6: Implement

Write the code changes per the finalized plan.

### Step 7: Verify (`/relay-verify`)

Checks each step against the plan, runs regression tests.

### Step 8: Notebook (`/relay-notebook`)

Creates and runs a Jupyter notebook that exercises the real project API end-to-end.

### Step 9: Resolve (`/relay-resolve`)

Archives the issue, creates implementation doc, updates ordering. Then run `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` to refresh status.

**The full lifecycle is documented in one place** — the archived issue file contains the original problem, plan, review, and verification report.

---

## Walkthrough: Building a Feature

### Step 1: Brainstorm (`/relay-brainstorm`)

Interactive exploration of the feature idea. Creates a brainstorm file with approaches, trade-offs, decisions, and feature breakdown.

### Step 2: Design (`/relay-design`)

Designs each feature in detail. Creates individual feature files with architecture, interfaces, data flow.

### Step 3: Prepare

Run `/relay-scan` and `/relay-order` to integrate features into the backlog.

### Step 4-9: Code pipeline

For each feature, in order:
```
/relay-analyze → /relay-plan → /relay-review → implement → /relay-verify → /relay-notebook → /relay-resolve
```

## Lifecycle of an Item

Every issue or feature follows the same documentation lifecycle. Each phase appends to the item file, building a complete record:

## Key Design Decisions

**Everything is persisted in `.md` files.** Plans, reviews, and verifications are appended to the item file — not left in conversation history. Any AI model or human can pick up where the last session left off.

**The code pipeline is the same for issues and features.** Whether you're fixing a one-line bug or building a multi-part feature, the same analyze → plan → review → implement → verify → notebook → resolve sequence applies.

**Archives are memory, not trash.** Resolved items go to `.relay/archive/`, not deleted. Every code skill reads the archives to avoid re-introducing old bugs.

**Reviews are adversarial by design.** `/relay-review` is framed as "try to break the plan" rather than "confirm it's good."

**Notebooks provide executable proof.** Verification notebooks aren't just documentation — they're run against the actual codebase.

**Every skill tells you what to do next.** Each skill ends with a Navigation section that explicitly tells you which skill to run next.

---

## Adding Skills

To extend the workflow with a new skill:

1. Create a new directory in `.claude/skills/relay-[name]/` with:
   - `SKILL.md` — frontmatter (name, description) + "Follow the instructions in ./workflow.md."
   - `workflow.md` — the full skill instructions

2. Wire it into the workflow:
   - Add a Navigation entry in the preceding skill that routes to the new one
   - Add it to the skill reference table in this file

3. If the skill requires project-specific customization:
   - Add a Phase 2 step in `/relay-setup` that detects project-specific values and populates `relay-config.md`

## Maintenance

**When to update skills:**
- After adding new integrations, services, or test frameworks — run `/relay-resolve` to refresh customizations, or re-run `/relay-setup` Phase 2
- After changing project structure (module renames, directory moves) — update scoping paths and test commands in `.relay/relay-config.md`
- After finding a workflow gap — fix the skill's `workflow.md`

**Feature file status lifecycle:**
- Brainstorm files: `BRAINSTORMING → READY FOR DESIGN → DESIGN COMPLETE → COMPLETE`
- Individual feature files: `DESIGNED` (created by `/relay-design`) → `IMPLEMENTED` (set by `/relay-resolve` before archiving)
