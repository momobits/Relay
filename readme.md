      persistent memory for AI workflows
```

A prompt-driven workflow system that gives AI coding agents persistent memory of what was built, what broke, and what's next. It replaces the ephemeral, conversation-scoped context that AI models operate in with a structured documentation system that survives across sessions, models, and teams.

## The Problem

When you use an AI model to build and maintain a codebase, every conversation starts from zero. The model doesn't know:

- What issue it fixed last week and how
- What feature it designed two hours ago
- Which approach was tried and rejected for a similar problem
- What other parts of the codebase were affected by recent changes
- What work is queued up and in what order it should be tackled

This means you repeat context, re-explain decisions, risk re-introducing fixed bugs, and lose the thread of multi-session work. The bigger the project gets, the worse this becomes.

## The Solution

Relay creates a **living documentation layer** that serves as the AI's project memory:

- **Issues and features** are documented in structured `.md` files with full context
- **Implementation plans, reviews, and verifications** are appended to those files as work progresses
- **Verification notebooks** (`.ipynb`) provide executable proof that changes work
- **Resolved items** are archived with implementation docs, preserving the full decision trail
- **Status and ordering** files are regenerated to reflect current project state
- **Project-specific customizations** are auto-detected during setup and maintained as the codebase evolves

Every AI session reads this documentation before acting. Every session writes back what it did. The result is a continuous, auditable record that any AI model (or human) can pick up and continue.

## How It Works

Relay has four prompt categories, each handling a phase of the development lifecycle:

```
PREPARE          DISCOVERY          FEATURE              CODE
(status)         (find work)        (design work)        (do work)

prepare_1        discovery_1        feature_1            code_1  (analyze)
  (scan)           (scan for          (brainstorm)          |
    |               issues)              |               code_2  (plan)
prepare_2        discovery_2        feature_2                |
  (order)          (file item)        (design)           code_3  (review)
                                         |                   |
                                   feature_3_cleanup     *implement*
                                     (archive stale          |
                                      brainstorms)       code_4  (verify)
                                                             |
                                                         code_5  (notebook)
                                                             |
                                                         code_6  (resolve)
```

The flow between categories: discovery/feature prompts create docs → prepare prompts prioritize them → code prompts implement them. Each prompt's Navigation section tells you what to run next.

### Workflow Paths

There are three entry points depending on what you're doing:

```
Specific issue  -->  discovery_2  -->  prepare_1 --> prepare_2 --> code_1 --> ... --> code_6
Systematic scan -->  discovery_1  -->  prepare_1 --> prepare_2 --> code_1 --> ... --> code_6
Feature idea    -->  feature_1   -->  feature_2  --> prepare_1 --> prepare_2 --> code_1 --> ... --> code_6
```

Note: `code_5` (notebook) is optional — you can skip directly from `code_4` to `code_6`. Each prompt tells you the next step via its Navigation section.

All paths converge on the same **code pipeline** for implementation, ensuring every change gets the same rigor regardless of how it was discovered.

## Prompt Reference

### Prepare — Project status and maintenance

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **[prepare_1_scan_and_status](prompts/prepare_1_scan_and_status.md)** | Scans all docs and codebase, produces `relay-status.md` with current state of every tracked item. Flags regressions in archived items. Maintains project-specific customizations as the codebase evolves. |
| **[prepare_2_generate_ordering](prompts/prepare_2_generate_ordering.md)** | Reads relay-status.md and all outstanding items, analyzes dependencies (using Development Order and Dependencies metadata from feature files), produces `relay-ordering.md` with prioritized phases. |

### Discovery — Finding and documenting work

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **[discovery_1_discover_issues](prompts/discovery_1_discover_issues.md)** | Systematic codebase scan for bugs, gaps, dead code, security issues, performance problems, test gaps. Creates issue files in `docs/issues/`. Checks archives to avoid re-reporting. |
| **[discovery_2_create_issue_or_feature](prompts/discovery_2_create_issue_or_feature.md)** | Quick-file tool for a specific bug or small feature. Supports two modes: in-context (you're investigating) or cross-chat handoff (paste findings from another session). |

### Feature — Designing new features

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **[feature_1_brainstorm](prompts/feature_1_brainstorm.md)** | Interactive exploration of a feature idea. Asks clarifying questions, explores codebase constraints, presents approaches with trade-offs. Creates one brainstorm file that accumulates decisions and names the feature files to create. |
| **[feature_2_design](prompts/feature_2_design.md)** | Takes the brainstorm and designs each feature in detail. Creates individual feature files with architecture, interfaces, data flow, and integration points. Each file links back to its brainstorm. Sets brainstorm status to DESIGN COMPLETE. |
| **[feature_3_cleanup](prompts/feature_3_cleanup.md)** | Archives abandoned brainstorm files that were never completed through feature_2_design. Checks brainstorm status and asks the user before archiving. |

### Code — Implementation pipeline

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **[code_1_analyze](prompts/code_1_analyze.md)** | Validates the item still exists, performs root cause / requirements analysis, maps blast radius (callers, consumers, tests, config, cross-item interactions, past work at risk). Reads ALL items and archives for full context. |
| **[code_2_plan](prompts/code_2_plan.md)** | Creates atomic, independently-verifiable implementation steps. Each step specifies WHAT, HOW, WHY, RISK, VERIFY, ROLLBACK. Plan is appended to the item file and persisted across sessions. |
| **[code_3_review](prompts/code_3_review.md)** | Adversarial review that tries to break the plan. Tests edge cases, checks for regressions, validates completeness. Produces a verdict: APPROVED, APPROVED WITH CHANGES, or REJECTED. |
| **[code_4_verify](prompts/code_4_verify.md)** | Post-implementation check: diff vs plan, completeness, correctness, regression tests. Produces a Verification Report appended to the item file. |
| **[code_5_notebook](prompts/code_5_notebook.md)** | Checks for notebook dependencies (Part 0), creates a Jupyter verification notebook, runs every cell, iterates until all pass. Classifies failures as notebook bugs, related project issues (fix inline), or unrelated issues (file via discovery_2). Optional — can skip to code_6_resolve. |
| **[code_6_resolve](prompts/code_6_resolve.md)** | Archives resolved items, creates implementation docs in `docs/implemented/`, updates brainstorm files, regenerates status. Works for both full-pipeline items and quick fixes. |

## Setup

### 1. Bootstrap Relay

Run the setup prompt to create the directory structure and all prompt files:

```
@docs/prompts/setup_workflow.md
```

This creates:

### 2. Project customization (automatic)

Setup Phase 2 scans your codebase and customizes Relay for your project:

- **Edge cases** (`code_3_review.md`): Discovers optional integrations, external services, feature flags, and config options — generates project-specific edge cases for adversarial reviews
- **Test commands** (`code_4_verify.md`): Detects test frameworks, directory structure, and import patterns — generates project-specific regression check commands
- **Notebook patterns** (`code_5_notebook.md`): Detects async patterns, connection teardown, logging flush timing — generates project-specific seed data, cleanup, and guidelines
- **Scoping paths** (`discovery_1_discover_issues.md`): Detects module structure — updates scan path examples
- **Python environment** (`.venv/`): Detects or creates a Python virtual environment and installs notebook execution dependencies (`nbclient`, `nbformat`, `nbconvert`). Required regardless of project language — notebooks can test any project via subprocess, HTTP, CLI, etc.

The AI presents each customization for your confirmation. If you're unsure, accept the scan defaults — `prepare_1_scan_and_status` maintains these automatically as the project evolves.

### 3. First run

```
1. @discovery_1_discover_issues.md    — scan the codebase for issues
2. @prepare_1_scan_and_status.md      — generate relay-status.md
3. @prepare_2_generate_ordering.md    — prioritize the work
4. Start working: @code_1_analyze.md  — pick the highest-priority item
```

## Walkthrough: Fixing a Bug

Here's a complete example of finding and fixing a bug, showing every file created and modified at each step.

### Step 1: Discover the issue

Run `@discovery_1_discover_issues.md` or `@discovery_2_create_issue_or_feature.md`. The AI scans the codebase and creates:

```
docs/issues/user_auth_token_expired_silently.md
```

```markdown
# User Auth Token Expires Silently

**Severity**: P1 — High

## Problem
When a user's auth token expires mid-session, API calls return
empty results instead of a 401 error. The client has no way to
know it needs to re-authenticate.

## Current State
- `src/auth/middleware.py` line 45: expired tokens pass validation
- `src/api/handler.py` line 112: catches auth errors but returns []

## Impact
Users see empty data and don't know why. No error in logs.

## Proposed Fix
Check token expiry in middleware, return 401 with clear message.

## Affected Files
- src/auth/middleware.py
- src/api/handler.py
- tests/test_auth.py
```

### Step 2: Update status and ordering

Run `@prepare_1_scan_and_status.md` then `@prepare_2_generate_ordering.md`.

`relay-status.md` now shows the new issue as OUTSTANDING. `relay-ordering.md` places it in Phase 1 based on severity.

### Step 3: Analyze (`code_1_analyze`)

Run `@code_1_analyze.md` — "I want to work on Phase 1."

The AI reads ALL issues, features, archives, and implemented docs. It re-reads the actual source files. It produces:

```
## Validation
- Problem still exists: YES (middleware.py line 45, handler.py line 112)
- Proposed fix still valid: YES

## Root Cause
- middleware.py checks token signature but not expiry timestamp
- handler.py catch-all masks the auth failure

## Blast Radius
- Files: middleware.py, handler.py, 2 test files
- Callers: every authenticated API endpoint (14 routes)
- Tests: test_auth.py has no expiry test case
- Config: TOKEN_EXPIRY_SECONDS setting is read but not enforced

## Approach
- Fix middleware to check expiry, return 401
- Remove catch-all in handler.py
- Add test for expired token
```

### Step 4: Plan (`code_2_plan`)

Run `@code_2_plan.md`. The AI creates an atomic plan and **appends it to the issue file**:

```markdown
---

## Implementation Plan

*Generated: 2025-01-15*

### Step 1: Add expiry check to middleware
**File**: src/auth/middleware.py
**Change**: After signature validation (line 45), add timestamp check
**Risk**: Could reject valid tokens if server clock is skewed
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_auth.py -v`
**Rollback**: Remove the expiry check, redeploy

### Step 2: Remove catch-all in handler
**File**: src/api/handler.py
**Change**: Replace catch-all with specific error handling
**Risk**: Unhandled exceptions could crash instead of returning []
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_api.py -v`
**Rollback**: Restore the catch-all

### Step 3: Add expired token test
**File**: tests/test_auth.py
**Change**: New test case with expired JWT
**Verify**: `pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_expired_token -v`

## Rollback Plan
1. `git revert HEAD~3..HEAD`
2. Redeploy
```

### Step 5: Adversarial review (`code_3_review`)

Run `@code_3_review.md`. The AI tries to break the plan:

```markdown
---

## Adversarial Review

*Reviewed: 2025-01-15*

### Issues Found
1. [Medium] Step 1 doesn't handle clock skew — add 30s grace period
2. [Low] Step 2 should log the error before returning 401

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Token with expiry exactly at current time (boundary)
- Token with no expiry field at all (malformed)

### Regression Risk
- None identified — the catch-all removal is safe because
  all auth errors are now handled explicitly

### Verdict
APPROVED WITH CHANGES: Add clock skew grace period to Step 1,
add logging to Step 2.
```

The Implementation Plan is updated in-place with the changes.

### Step 6: Implement

Write the code changes per the finalized plan.

### Step 7: Verify (`code_4_verify`)

Run `@code_4_verify.md`. The AI checks each step against the plan:

```markdown
---

## Verification Report

*Verified: 2025-01-15*

### Implementation Status
| Step | Planned | Implemented | Correct |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 1    | Expiry check + grace period | YES | YES |
| 2    | Remove catch-all + logging  | YES | YES |
| 3    | Expired token test          | YES | YES |

### Test Results
- 47 passed, 0 failed

### Verdict
COMPLETE
```

### Step 8: Verification notebook (`code_5_notebook`)

Run `@code_5_notebook.md`. Creates and runs:

```
docs/notebooks/user_auth_token_expired_silently.ipynb
```

The notebook ingests test data, verifies expired tokens return 401, checks that valid tokens still work, and tests boundary conditions. All cells pass.

### Step 9: Resolve (`code_6_resolve`)

Run `@code_6_resolve.md`. The AI:

1. Creates `docs/implemented/user_auth_token_expired_silently.md` with a summary of what was done
2. Moves the issue to `docs/archive/issues/user_auth_token_expired_silently.md` with an ARCHIVED banner
3. Moves the notebook to `docs/archive/notebooks/`
4. Regenerates relay-status.md and relay-ordering.md

**The full lifecycle is now documented in one place** — the archived issue file contains the original problem, the plan, the review, and the verification report.

---

## Walkthrough: Building a Feature

Here's a complete example of designing and building a multi-part feature.

### Step 1: Brainstorm (`feature_1_brainstorm`)

Run `@feature_1_brainstorm.md` — "I want to explore adding a caching layer."

The AI asks clarifying questions, explores the codebase, presents approaches. After several rounds of conversation, it creates:

```
docs/features/caching_brainstorm.md
```

```markdown
# Feature Brainstorm: Caching Layer

*Created: 2025-01-16*
*Status: READY FOR DESIGN*

## Goal
Reduce database load by caching frequently accessed queries.

## Approaches Considered
### Approach A: Redis cache
- Pros: fast, battle-tested. Cons: new infrastructure dependency.
- Verdict: SELECTED

### Approach B: In-memory LRU
- Pros: no external dependency. Cons: not shared across instances.
- Verdict: REJECTED — multi-instance deployment planned.

## Decisions Made
1. Use Redis with configurable TTL per query type
2. Cache invalidation on write, not time-based
3. Feature must be opt-in (disabled by default)

## Feature Breakdown
| # | Feature File | Description | Suggested Order | Dependencies |
|---|-------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 1 | `cache_infrastructure.md` | Redis connection, config, health check | Build first | None |
| 2 | `cache_query_layer.md` | Query result caching with invalidation | Build second | Depends on 1 |

## Development Order
Build infrastructure first, then the query layer.
```

### Step 2: Design (`feature_2_design`)

Run `@feature_2_design.md`. The AI reads the brainstorm, designs each feature iteratively, creates:

```
docs/features/cache_infrastructure.md    — Redis connection, config, health check
docs/features/cache_query_layer.md       — Query caching with invalidation logic
```

Each file links back to the brainstorm and specifies its position in the development order.

### Step 3: Prepare

Run `@prepare_1_scan_and_status.md` and `@prepare_2_generate_ordering.md` to integrate the features into the project backlog.

### Step 4-9: Code pipeline

For each feature, in order:

```
code_1_analyze  →  code_2_plan  →  code_3_review  →  implement  →  code_4_verify  →  code_5_notebook  →  code_6_resolve
```

When `code_6_resolve` archives the second feature, it updates the brainstorm file's status to COMPLETE.

## Lifecycle of an Item

Every issue or feature follows the same documentation lifecycle. Each phase appends to the item file, building a complete record:

## Key Design Decisions

**Everything is persisted in `.md` files.** Plans, reviews, and verifications are appended to the item file — not left in conversation history. Any AI model or human can pick up where the last session left off.

**The code pipeline is the same for issues and features.** Whether you're fixing a one-line bug or building a multi-part feature, the same analyze → plan → review → implement → verify → notebook → resolve sequence applies. This ensures consistent rigor.

**Archives are memory, not trash.** Resolved items go to `docs/archive/`, not deleted. Every code prompt reads the archives to avoid re-introducing old bugs, duplicating past approaches, or conflicting with previous work.

**Brainstorm files are accumulation points.** A single brainstorm file captures the full exploration of a feature idea — approaches considered, decisions made, and the breakdown into individual feature files. This prevents the common AI pattern of exploring an idea once, losing it, and starting over.

**Reviews are adversarial by design.** `code_3_review` is framed as "try to break the plan" rather than "confirm it's good." This produces significantly better results — the AI finds real problems instead of rubber-stamping.

**Notebooks provide executable proof.** Verification notebooks aren't just documentation — they're run against the actual codebase. If a cell fails, the workflow classifies the failure and either fixes it inline or files a new issue.

**Status files are generated, not edited.** `relay-status.md` and `relay-ordering.md` are regenerated by the prepare prompts. This prevents drift between documentation and reality.

**Project customizations are auto-maintained.** Edge cases, test commands, notebook patterns, and scan paths are detected during setup and kept current by `prepare_1` on every status scan. The workflow adapts as your project evolves without manual intervention.

**Every prompt tells you what to do next.** Each prompt ends with a `## Navigation` section that explicitly tells the user which prompt to run next, including verdict-based routing (e.g., APPROVED → implement → verify, REJECTED → revise plan). No more guessing what `@file.md` to type.

**All dates use YYYY-MM-DD format.** Every date placeholder in the workflow (`*Generated:*`, `*Reviewed:*`, `*Verified:*`, etc.) uses ISO 8601 format for consistency across item files.
